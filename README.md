Dog Shelter Simulation
This program simulates the placement and care of dogs in a shelter. Each dog is placed into a cage based on its type, arrival time, and service duration.

Key Features:
Dog Types and Priorities: Dogs are categorized into "Dangerous (D)", "Unwell (U)", and "Well (W)" types, each with a specific priority (D=3, U=2, W=1).

Cage Management: Dogs are assigned to a limited number of cages in the shelter, based on their arrival times.

Random Dog Data Generation: Data for each dog, such as type, arrival time, and service time, is generated randomly.

Statistics: After the simulation, statistics such as the total waiting time, cage usage, and dog types are reported.

Program Flow:
Dog Data Creation: The program generates dogs based on user-provided parameters.

Dog Placement: Dogs are sequentially placed into the shelter, with each being assigned to an available cage.

Cage and Dog Management: The status of each cage (empty/occupied) is continuously monitored, and dogs are placed accordingly.

Reporting: At the end of the simulation, a report summarizing each dog's care data is generated.

Report Results:
Total Waiting Time: The total time dogs spent in the queue.

Cage Usage: How many times each cage was used.

Dog Types: How many dogs of each type were admitted.

Dog Statistics: Detailed information about the dogs' waiting times and movements within the shelter.
